# beam
File transfer - transfers files to other copies of itself

A rewrite from memory of an earlier program. If two computers are both running Beam, you can send files from one to the other by beaming the file across to a machine name or IP address. 

Push is implemented. Pull is not. So, you can beam up but you can't beam down. 

Memory is bad, since Beam is not listening for remote connections. Need to fix that.
